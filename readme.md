# Noise Cancellation C++

A high-performance audio noise cancellation engine written entirely in C++. It uses a hybrid approach, combining traditional Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques with a trained PyTorch Machine Learning model to intelligently remove background noise from audio files.

The system is designed for efficiency and real-time processing capabilities, making it a suitable core for applications requiring low-latency audio enhancement.

## Core Features

*   **Hybrid Processing:** Leverages a `traced_denoiser_model.pt` (a TorchScript model exported from Python) to guide a DSP-based spectral subtraction algorithm.
*   **Intelligent Adaptation:** Analyzes audio in real-time to determine characteristics like Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and noise type, adapting its processing strategy accordingly.
*   **Frame-Based, Real-Time Capable:** Processes audio in small chunks with very low latency (~1-2 ms per frame), suitable for live audio streams.
*   **High Performance:** Built in C++ and linked against the LibTorch library for maximum computational efficiency.
*   **Modular Design:** Separates concerns into distinct modules for audio I/O, VAD, DSP, and ML processing.

## Dependencies

To build and run this project, you will need:
*   A C++17 compliant compiler (e.g., Clang, GCC)
*   CMake (version 3.15 or later)
*   **LibTorch:** The C++ distribution of PyTorch. [Download here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
*   **libsndfile:** A library for reading and writing audio files.
    *   On macOS: `brew install libsndfile`
    *   On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev`

## Build Instructions

1.  **Download and setup LibTorch**:
    Download LibTorch from the official PyTorch website. After extracting the archive:
    
    **For macOS users:** Remove quarantine attributes to prevent security warnings:
    ```bash
    xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine "/path/to/libtorch"
    ```

2.  **Configure `CMakeLists.txt`**:
    Open the `CMakeLists.txt` file and set the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` variable to the absolute path of your unzipped LibTorch installation directory.
    ```cmake
    set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "/path/to/your/libtorch")
    ```

3.  **Create a build directory**:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

4.  **Generate the build system**:
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

5.  **Compile the project**:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    An executable named `NoiseCancellation` will be created inside the `build` directory.

## Usage

Run the executable from the **project root directory**, providing an input file and an output file as arguments.

```bash
# General Usage
./build/NoiseCancellation <path/to/input.wav> <path/to/output.wav>

# Example

### C++ Hybrid Noise Cancellation: Performance Comparison

The following table compares the performance of the C++ noise cancellation engine on two distinct audio files: one with difficult, broadband white noise and another with more structured, low-frequency traffic noise. The results demonstrate the system's ability to analyze the input and adapt its processing strategy accordingly.

| Metric | `noisy_white.wav` (Difficult) | `noisy_traffic.wav` (Moderate) | Analysis of aaptive Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input Analysis** | | | |
| Average Estimated SNR | **1.36 dB** | 4.08 dB | **Correct Diagnosis:** The system accurately identified the white noise as having a significantly lower Signal-to-Noise Ratio. |
| Dominant Noise Type | **Broadband (95%)** | **Low-Frequency (99%)** | **Accurate Classification:** The engine correctly profiled the noise in each file, which is crucial for selecting the right strategy. |
| **Strategy & Performance** | | | |
| Strategy Distribution | **99.6% Aggressive** | 54% Aggressive, 46% Balanced | **Intelligent Adaptation:** The system went "all-in" on the difficult noise but used a more nuanced, quality-preserving approach on the traffic noise. |
| Average Noise Reduction | **25.87 dB** | 12.64 dB | **Effective & Appropriate Action:** Achieved outstanding reduction on the difficult file by being aggressive. Applied a more moderate reduction on the traffic noise to protect speech fidelity. |
| Average Processing Time | 1.23 ms / frame | 1.14 ms / frame | **Excellent Performance:** Both scenarios are processed nearly 10x faster than the typical real-time requirement of ~10ms. |
| **Intelligent Fusion** | | | |
| Average DSP / ML Weight | 0.46 / 0.54 | 0.52 / 0.48 | **Dynamic Weighting:** The system subtly shifted its trust, leaning more on ML for broadband noise and slightly more on DSP for structured traffic noise. |
